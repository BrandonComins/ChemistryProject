Living things are a collection of molecules. Living things are made up of DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic acid. These two things along with many other things belong in cells. Living things are made up of many cells. Hooke discovered the first cells in a piece of cork. 
	<br>Charles Darwin discovered natural selection. This is where an animal adapts to its surroundings over time. This jump started the discovery of evolution and mutation in DNA. Mutation is what leads to DNA changing and adapting to their surroundings. 

<br>Mendel cross bred plants and showed mutation to be possible. He also learned about hereditary genes. He created the punnett square to predict what genes the plants would pass down to the child.

<br> 97% of DNA in every human is the same. 3% of DNA in humans are what make us different. We are lucky that DNA is able to replicate itself, otherwise we wouldn't be "human." DNA replication can go wrong, which would cause a mutation. If that happens you can get a disorder, or eventually evolve if a bunch of people are being mutated in the same way.


<br> Before Linnaeus people didn't know how to properly classify organisms. The organization was all over the place. Then, Linnaeus created the Linnaean system to classify organisms. This is our modern day model to classify organisms. It goes Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Linnaeus is considered the father of taxonomy. There are plenty of new species we are still discovering today.

<br> Life on earth started 3.85 billion years ago. The life consisted of Cyanobacteria. The Earth was not always has suited for humans to live as it is today. There was very little oxygen and poison gases around.  To think humans evolved from Cyanobacteria and earth became a perfect environment for humans is extremely lucky. 2 billion years ago complex life began. The mitochondria allowed for complex life to happen.

<br> Bacteria are everywhere. Bacteria can be harmful and helpful. Bacteria can infect you and make you sick. Other bacteria can protect your body parts from other invaders. Antibiotics will kill bacteria. ANTIBIOTICS DOES NOT TREAT VIRAL ILLNESS! Humans are using AntiBiotics so much that Bacteria are growing a tolerance to it.

<br> A virus is debated on whether it is alive or not. They are considered dead because they don't follow most guidelines to be defined "alive,"  but others argue that they are alive, because they invade a cell, take it over, and multiply, then take over other cells.

<br> Lastly, Fungi play a major role in life. They decompose dead things. They also make food like yeast and cheese.
