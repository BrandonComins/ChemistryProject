<p><font color = "red" size = "6px">This book spends the first of many long chapters talking about space and physics. Back when I was interested in the book, we were learning about the creation of the universe. Creationism, where god created everything was the paradigm of the time. When natural selection and evolution was introduced to the public, people started to believe in the Big Bang Theory. If fact it is predicted that there is still some left over radiation in space from the BigBang. They then talked about the edge of space. No one knows what it is like at the edge of space, but it is practically impossible to reach. They also mentioned that the Universe was always very slowly expanding.
	<br>The book next talked about Pluto. Scientists debated whether it was a planet or not. After years of debating it was decided that it was a planet. The main arguments against it was that the planet is an ice ball, and that the orbit and planet size were queer.
	<br>Next Bryson talked about Mars. Mars is extremely expensive and dangerous to reach. It is so expensive that Astronauts have never made it to mars. Then, Bryson talked about aliens. He believes they exist but he doesn't think that they have ever reached earth. He also doesn't believe that aliens are the way they are portrayed in the movies. Aliens would be at least 200 light years away from earth. Even if Aliens had the technology to reach Earth, picking Earth at random out of the entire universe would be nearly impossible.
	<br>Bryson then talks about The Oort cloud and supernovae. The Oort cloud is a collection of comets. SuperNovae are a collection of large stars. They often explode. Earth is not in harms way of supernovae because the closest one is at least 169,000 light years away from earth. In order to be in harms way the exploding supernova would need to be within 500 light years from Earth, and Earth's ozone layer would need to be weak.
	<br>Scientists all over the world tried to discover mass of Earth. Scientists like Hutton, would try to use contour lines to find Earth's median then calculate the mass. They then found out that this method wasnâ€™t the most reliable. Today, no one exactly sure of the mass of Earth.
