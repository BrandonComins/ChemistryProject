Here are some random facts I got out of this section of the book: Without an atmosphere Earth would freeze over, and everything would die. At high altitudes there is less oxygen, higher wind speed, and different air pressures. Oceans transport heat. Pressure is really hard to handle at the bottom of the ocean, and high into the air. Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere are the four layers of our atmosphere. If we donâ€™t protect our atmosphere and play into Global warming, we will all die.
