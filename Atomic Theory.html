Alchemy came before chemistry. Alchemy was pure and simple where elements transform naturally, while chemistry is forcing bonds together. Karl Scheele an alchemist was both very smart and stupid He discovered many compounds like Ammonia, Glycerin, and more. He was stupid because he tasted everything he used, and died. Chemistry lost its bearings in the 19th century due to lack of equipment. 
<br>People of the early 20th century did not understand the potential harms of radiation and lead and radiation considering that they lead in toys, and radioactive elements in consumer products. 
<br>All things are made of atoms. In fact, we are all billions of years old because when something dies, the atoms disassemble and find something else to attach itself to.
<br>Some of the more important scientists in atomic theory are Dalton and Rutherford. Dalton gave atomic weights to elements, which greatly impacted modern science. Rutherford conducted the gold foil experiment and discovered electrons.
<br>This section ends with the periodic table and how it got it's name by the elements being periodic.
