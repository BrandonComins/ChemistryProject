	<br>This section starts by mentioning a weird phenomenon of the early times. Marine fossils were appearing on mountains. Paleontologists were split into plutonists and neptunists. James Hutton proposed that fossils were in a spot, and the spot formed a mountain Earth's heat.
 <br>The book then talked about scientists disproving the biblical view of the Catastrophism. "Noah did not rescue the animals" they all died in a flood. Then fossils of the marine animals went on today's surface, which is one way how they ended up on mountains.
<br> Many scientists wanted to find the age of the Earth. One man named Comte de Buffon tried finding the specific heat of some stone balls, and relating it to earth. He stopped his experiments because he was threatened to be excommunicated from the church. Lord Kelvin argued that the Earth is actually young. He thought this because there was nothing at the time that could explain how the sun could be burning for millions of years of years.
	<br>In the 18th century America wanted to start documents it's large animals because fossils and bones started "appearing" all over the place. After finding bones that didn't belong to any present day animals, people determined that some creatures went extinct. Religion didn't believe in extinction and argued "why would god create something to only wipe it out later." Mary Anning later found fossils of an plesiosaurus, and an pterodactyl.
	<br>Then the book focuses more on geology and would get back to fossils later. It talks about how the deepest mines on earth are two miles deep. Andrija discovered the mantle and crust as two different layers. The deepest mines don't go past the crust.
	<br>Earthquakes are caused by magnitude, convulsive force, and the releasing forces of energy. Bryson talks about the Richter Scale and how lots of non scientists don't understand it properly. The Richter scale measures force, not damage. Every day earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or greater occur every day. Earthquakes caused many disasters like in the Tokyo Great Kanto earthquake.
	<br>Bryson then gets into hot spots and volcanic activity. "Hot spots are places within the mantle where rocks melt to generate magma." Geysers, hot springs and mud spots all have hot spots below them. If Yellowstone Park erupts it can be extremely dangerous to the US because the ashes from the eruption travels far and is deadly. Today, we know for a fact that YellowStone is still active because of the pressure exerts had made the spot rise.
	<br>Next Bryson talks about the things that make us very lucky to be living on earth. Location, timing, good planet, twin planet, are the four principles that lead it to being habitable for humans. Orbit Interior, location, weather, oxygen supply, great ozone, able to grow food, water supply, if other creatures exist, good soil, are ten things humans need for a planet to be habitable for them.
<br>Bryson then goes back to Paleontology and talks about the requirements for a fossil. "First, you must die. Then, You must maintain shape and form despite rocks and sediments crushing the fossil. Lastly, It must be found after tons of years." Fossils are rare because only one in one billion bones actually become fossilized. 95% of the fossils we have are marine animals. The average lifespan of the fossils are four million years, and there have been five major extinctions in life.
<br>Scientists were struggling with classifying animals. They were at first classifying them by similarity. That then soon fell apart. The organism kingdom later developed into domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.

<br> Bryson then goes into the Ice Age. He talks about how glacier episodes, and how temperature changes have been happening. As years go on the world gets warmer. Glaciers are melting and ocean level is increasing. In fact if all the ice sheets melt then the ocean level would rise 200 feet. Our ozone layer is being destroyed, and if that happens the planet will die due to solar radiation.

<br> Bryson talks about early humans and their lifestyle. Early humans, also know as Neanderthals come from Europe. The Ice ages allowed humans to evolve, or die. Human's first hand made tool was the hand axe. Humans split off into different waves, and migrated to different places. Early human bones and DNA extremely hard to find. It is sometimes difficult to determine if the human bones was from before the common era, or from some war in ancient times. That is if they even find human bones, which are really hard to find. 

<br>To end the book Bryson talks about humans and animal extinctions. As humans it is our fault for some of the animal extinctions because we took their homes and turned it into shopping malls.
